This repository contains various Rust programs that i'm writing during my learning process of the language.

I'm using two books to learn Rust:
- [The Rust Programming Language](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/rust-book)
- [Command-Line Rust](https://github.com/kyclark/command-line-rust)
